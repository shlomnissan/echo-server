# üåç tcp-echo-server

This project is a simple implementation of a TCP echo server using BSD sockets that I put together to explore different methods of synchronous I/O multiplexing in a Linux environment.

It allows for the selection of a multiplexing method using an application argument. Available methods are select, poll, and epoll, and each method has performance and cross-platform compatibility trade-offs.

*Note*: this program uses epoll, a Linux kernel system call, so it can only be compiled in a Linux environment.

### Usage
```
echo_server 8080 epoll
```
- `arg[1]` the port you want the server to bind to.
- `arg[2]` the multiplexing method you want to use (select, poll, or epoll).

Both areguments are required.
